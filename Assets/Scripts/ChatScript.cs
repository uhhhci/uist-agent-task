    *  Something to display the user's and agent's messages. You probably want to place the messages in the ScrollRect's content object. 
    *  You need to be able to hide and display the loading icon. You can do this by setting the active state of the loading icon's game object. The loading icon should also be animated via script or animation. (e.g. rotate the icon)
    *  What color should the agent's messages be? What color should the user's messages be?
